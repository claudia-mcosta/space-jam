/* TO DO
 *
 * Overall cleanup with methods and classes
 * Animations
 * Clear field at start and clear shootOut at end
 * Place score in Player? Find best place/object/class for methods
 * Creating a grid would be nice
 * Add message with shootOut explanation before start that goes away once player presses "I" to start shootOut?
